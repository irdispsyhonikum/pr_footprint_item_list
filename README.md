# footprints I am using
I've downloaded this footprints for various EDA editors through mouser.co.uk but originaly provided by samac sys.
You can use LibraryLoader to upload them to EDA you are using. from KiCad till Altium designer.
Here you can find a mix from eMMC till 10W resistor. 
I had saved them for myself, but hope they will be usefull for someone else. 
Just in case, they can be downloaded for free trough resources I provided here on the top. 
I will make list with explanation of mfr. no's if will get bored someday.
